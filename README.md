# Module 19 challenge: Text Editor

## Description

This Module 19 Challenge repository was created to complete the Module 19 Challenge of the bootcamp.

This project aims to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria.  Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Installation

Please make sure to run the command "npm install" to install all required node modules before running the program. 
Please also make sure to run the command "npm run build" to install all client-side modules. 

## Usage

Please run the command "npm run start:dev" in terminal to start the server.
